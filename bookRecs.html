       <p>When I read this trilogy at 15, they were the most attention-grabbing books I've ever read. The whole 'teenagers killing each other to survive' set-up was such a non-mainstream concept. Although it's labelled as dystopian futuristic, it eerily represents the real world's political scene, and portrays complex ethical dillemas. The protagonist,Katniss,is such a bad-ass, inspiring woman. There's definitely more to this book than just a love triangle and broody teenagers.</p><a href="#" class="close">x</a></div>

        <p>Hands-down the best book series I've ever read. There are 13 books in total. but each book itself isn't to thick. It's a bit on the kiddie side, but it's got a lot of dark humour, sarcastic narration and irony that make it engaging for even adults. Lemony Snicket's (the author) wiritng style really cpatures my attention. He seems like a really cool person to be friends with.</p><a href="#" class="close">x</a></div>

        <p>I'm a sucker for physological books with plot twists. And this book is exactly that. All E.Lockhart books have stellar plot twists. I'm not gonna say much about the plot since I might spoil too much, but here's what hooked me to the book : the story was told backwards, from the end to the beginning. When I realised the chapters were intentionally in reverse order, I was like "YES".

          <p>This is a fantasy trilogy in the Grishaverse universe. Personally, it was one of the less intersting books I've read, but only because I've read a ton of fantasy books so I found it a bit cliched. But from an unbiased perspective, it's actually really interesting. A lot of Harry Potter vibes. Props to Leigh Budrow for creating a whole universe in such detail that could compete with the Harry Potter universe.</p><a href="#" class="close">x</a>

        <p>This duology is also part of the Grishaverse(see 'Shadow and Bone'). I REALLY enjoyed this series just because the characters were a bunch of misfit criminals instead of your average hero 'do-gooder' protagonist. Author's writing style is really witty in this one. Also the relationships between the characters are so pure!!</p><a href="#" class="close">x</a></div></div></div>

        <p>A standalone dystopian book with a really cool concept where people start losing their shadows, and as a consequence, they start losing their memories too. The writing was definitely more mature here. The book was writren in the perspective of adult characters, so it was a nice change from all the YA books I read.</p><a href="#" class="close">x</a></div></div></div>

        <p>If you were a fan of the Percy Jackson series, this is the book for you. It is a retelling of the Greek mythology which tells the tale of two lovers, Achilles and Patroclus. It gave me a deeper insight to the Greek era, and it's filled with deep quotes that you could probably use to impress your crush ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. </p><a href="#" class="close">x</a></div></div></div>

        <p>Another non-fiction, but slightly more scientific. This book is all about genetics. The historical discoveries of the DNA structure,introns,exons,gene coding, and even highlights ethical issues that came with learning how to manipulate DNA.

        <p>A classic psychological thriller with a plot twist that I never saw coming. E.Lockhart(author) really knows how to grasp his audience's attention. It's got a bit of that summer vibe since majority of the story takes place at the protagonist's summer home. All E.Lockhart books are a must-read.</p><a href="#" class="close">x</a></div></div></div>

        <p>Another dystopian book!(yes I'm obssessed with them).This is a trilogy that got me hooked. It's set in a world where all women died and only men remained. And everyone can hear what the other person is saying (it's known as "The Noise").I really liked this book because there really was no 'good guy' and 'bad guy'. The author made you sympathise with all the characters.</p><a href="#" class="close">x</a></div></div></div>

        <p>This is a period novel, set during World War 2. It simultaneously tells 2 stories, one about a blind French girl, and a German boy enlisted to join the Nazis. It's heartbreaking to read about how the innocence was stripped from these two children. But most importantly, it shows how we are all born with kindness and goodness ingrained in us, and that is the core of humanity, regardless of race or nationality.</p><a href="#" class="close">x</a></div></div></div>

It tells the story of a little girl, Scout, and her lawyer-dad Atticus.Reading from Scout's POV, it shows the simplicity of how children view adult problems, and how they're really not that complicated.</p><a href="#" class="close">x</a></div></div></div>
